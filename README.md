A data analysis project exploring customer purchasing behaviour at Pelican Stores, a division of National Clothing. 
---

## 📋 Project Overview

Pelican Stores ran a promotional campaign where discount coupons were distributed to customers of other National Clothing stores. A sample of **100 in-store credit card transactions** was collected during the promotion to help management understand their customer base and evaluate the campaign's effectiveness.

This project performs a full **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on that dataset, covering descriptive statistics, distributions, and visual insights.
